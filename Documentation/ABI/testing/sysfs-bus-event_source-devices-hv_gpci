Description:    Read-only. Attribute group to describe the magic bits
                that go into perf_event_attr.config for a particular pmu.
                (See ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-event_source-devices-format).

                Each attribute under this group defines a bit range of the
                perf_event_attr.config. All supported attributes are listed
                below::

				counter_info_version  = "config:16-23"
				length  = "config:24-31"
				partition_id  = "config:32-63"
				request = "config:0-31"
				sibling_part_id = "config:32-63"
				hw_chip_id = "config:32-63"
				offset = "config:32-63"
				phys_processor_idx = "config:32-63"
				secondary_index = "config:0-15"
				starting_index = "config:32-63"

                For example::

		  processor_core_utilization_instructions_completed = "request=0x94,
					phys_processor_idx=?,counter_info_version=0x8,
					length=8,offset=0x18"

		In this event, '?' after phys_processor_idx specifies this value
		this value will be provided by user while running this event.

		This sysfs file exposes the system topology information by making HCALL
		H_GET_PERF_COUNTER_INFO. The HCALL is made with token request type
		PROCESSOR_BUS_TOPOLOGY(0xD0).
		* The end user reading this sysfs file need to decode the result's data format as per
		  getPerfCountInfo documentation, for the underneath platform/firmware.
		* This sysfs file is only available for power10 and later platforms. Incase the HCALL
		  failed with hardware/permission issue or the support for PROCESSOR_BUS_TOPOLOGY token
		  removed from future platforms, this sysfs file still be created and error out
		  when reading it.

		Below are currently known returned values when making H_GET_PERF_COUNTER_INFO hcall.

		* "H_AUTHORITY" : Partition is not permitted to retrieve performance information,
				  required to set "Enable Performance Information Collection" option.

		* "H_NOT_AVAILABLE" : Requested system information is not available for the firmware
				      level and platform.

		* "H_PRIVILEGE" : Can't retrieve system information because of invalid buffer length
				  or invalid address. Refer getPerfCountInfo v1.018 documentation for
				  more information.

		* "H_HARDWARE" : Can't retrieve system information because of hardware error.
				 For ex: Physical memory issue which results in not able to read
				 memory data.

		* "H_PARAMETER" : Partial system information returned because of limited buffer size.


		* "H_SUCCESS" : Successfully returned system information in the requested buffer.
